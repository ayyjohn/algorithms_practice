# Write a function that takes a year (a 4 digit integer) and returns an array with the 10 closest subsequent years
# that satisfy the following condition: The first two digits summed with the last two digits are equal to the
# middle two digits

# eg: 1978 => 19 + 78 = 97
# eg: 2307 => 23 + 07 = 30
